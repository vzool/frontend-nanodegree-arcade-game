# Project Solution

I begin my code with thoughts of sepration and modularity which I can explain it as point as following:

1. I try to build/Draw game world by structure that already exists.
2. I try to Draw a player(Hero).
3. Just move Player by keyboard arrow actions.
4. Move player in known coordinates.
5. Try Player not to move out of his world.
6. Draw one enemy at any location.
7. Make enemy just move by itself from left to right at known x coordinates.
8. Make enemies generated automatically and randomly among known x coordinates.
9. Check X hits between Player and enemies.
10. Add feature reset game or Player position if hit occures.
11. Check Y hits between Player and enemies.
12. Optimize Hits trigger for Reset.
